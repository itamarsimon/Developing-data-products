# Developing-data-products

## General

- In this presentation I attempted to show obesity rates in the US for each state for years 2012-2016. 
- The original data comes from the following website: <https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/> and the actual data was downloaded from: <https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/api/views/hn4x-zwk7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD>
- Due to the fact that the original data source was large, I used a reduced and cleaner version for this app.
- The app could be accessed from the following link: <https://itamarsimon.shinyapps.io/obesity/>
